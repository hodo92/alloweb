#### _An Angular application that connects children and parents for the purpose of managing tasks, chores, and allowance.  The parent can assign tasks with conditions to their child, who can then complete them.  Once completed, the parent can approve the completed task and pay the predetermined payment to the child.  The child can then use the money towards items in his wishlist, which he can customize using Ebay's item lookup API._
